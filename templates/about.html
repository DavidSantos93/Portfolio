        After finishing my Bachelor in Eletromechanical Engineering, I worked in this field for about a year until I
        realized I wanted what I always felt attracted to, programming. <br>
        Heard from a friend about Udemy and decided to take a few courses alongside a lot of youtube tutorials on Python
        overall, some CSS, HTML and Bootstrap and also Linux, after that I learned that within programming I also really
        enjoyed working with data, so I took another course in a different field: Google Data Analytics Course. <br>
        So now I feel job ready and I am looking to get into one of those fields while still improving my data analytics
        skills and getting into machine learning and data science.
